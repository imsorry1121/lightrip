Lightrip - Managing your trip by easy drag-and-drop move 

Coordinators: Ken Chen, Pin-Yen Lee, Cytms
Skills:       ROR, FB API, and Google Maps API
Work Review:  We redesign the UI of travel websites, put the spotsâ€™ information on the map and calculate the transportation time between every two spots, so as to make traveler arrange and edit their trips much easier and faster.  The user can login in by Facebook account, save the schedule, and share schedule. We strive to develop the coordination platform to make different people edit the schedule simultaneously, but unfinished.
